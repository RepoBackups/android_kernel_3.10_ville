* ARM architected timer

<<<<<<< HEAD
ARM Cortex-A7 and Cortex-A15 have a per-core architected timer, which
provides a per-cpu local timer.

The timer is attached to a GIC to deliver its two per-processor
interrupts (one for the secure mode, one for the non-secure mode).

** Timer node properties:

- compatible : Should be "arm,armv7-timer"

- interrupts : One or two interrupts for secure and non-secure mode
=======
ARM cores may have a per-core architected timer, which provides per-cpu timers.

The timer is attached to a GIC to deliver its per-processor interrupts.

** Timer node properties:

- compatible : Should at least contain one of
	"arm,armv7-timer"
	"arm,armv8-timer"

- interrupts : Interrupt list for secure, non-secure, virtual and
  hypervisor timers, in that order.

- clock-frequency : The frequency of the main counter, in Hz. Optional.

Example:

	timer {
<<<<<<< HEAD
		compatible = "arm,armv7-timer"";
		interrupts = <1 13 0xf08 1 14 0xf08>;
=======
		compatible = "arm,cortex-a15-timer",
			     "arm,armv7-timer";
		interrupts = <1 13 0xf08>,
			     <1 14 0xf08>,
			     <1 11 0xf08>,
			     <1 10 0xf08>;
>>>>>>> common/android-3.10.y
		clock-frequency = <100000000>;
	};
